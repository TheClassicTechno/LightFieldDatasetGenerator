# Light Field Datasets Script
RandomObjectSpawner

This repository contains code (in C#) for the Unity Scripts for generating custom light field datasets. <br>

It also includes our CNN prototype model code in Google Colab and data preprocessing Jupyter notebook uploaded from our Kaggle account. See our original Kaggle code at: https://www.kaggle.com/code/julesh7/light-field-data-processing-w-pytorch

In addition, visit https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julesh7/rgb-light-field-dataset to see our light field datasets generated using our novel Unity approach.
